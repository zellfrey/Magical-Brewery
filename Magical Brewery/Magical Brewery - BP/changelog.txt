I will continue with PBR textures at a later date. For now, I've just added

Okay, im back babyyyy. This update took longer than expected, not because of any
addon hiccups, no it was because I was playing Soul Steel.
Anyway, xlong & xstrong Potions are now available, and can be used in aging.
Please note, that the potions; oozing, weaving, infested and windcharged aren't
available at the moment. That will be the next update, i promise
