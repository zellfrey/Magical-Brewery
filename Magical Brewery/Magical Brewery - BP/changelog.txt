v0.4
Added:
    - Seal of Retainment
    - Cask quality variants (ranging from 1-4)
    - Cask(no effect)
    - Oozing, Wind Charged, Infested, Weaving potions have been added to Glass Potions + Creative Categories
    - Cask aging has a new parameter that determines whether certain seals can affect the aging process of potions
        E.g. A seal of potency will not be used with a cask of water breathing as there is no potency variant.

    - Cask degrading chapter added to Brewer's tome
Updated:
    - Cask & Budding Crystal databases have better checks when objects are created.
Author comment:
A bigger update, one that took a lot more time than usual. The main reason being dealing with the laborious task
of adding all cask variant textures manually.

Okay, im back babyyyy. This update took longer than expected, not because of any
addon hiccups, no it was because I was playing Soul Steel.
Anyway, xlong & xstrong Potions are now available, and can be used in aging.
Please note, that the potions; oozing, weaving, infested and windcharged aren't
available at the moment. That will be the next update, i promise

Amazing timing of me to upload an addon just before a game drop.
