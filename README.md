# Magical Brewery - A bedrock addon


Magical Brewery introduces further depth to minecraft's brewing system. Not only that, it throws many twists to compliment the brewing experience
and expands many aspects of a mechanic that unfortunately seems forgotten.<br/>  
However, this isn't just aimed to be a vanilla+ addon, as in the future there will be more features that will emphasise the mod's theme.

You can find the latest .mcaddon file at [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft-bedrock/addons/magical-brewery).
