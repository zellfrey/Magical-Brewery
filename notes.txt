scrapped texture overlaying and data driven textures. THey just dont have that POW to them
lang file, full stop is needed in some cases, string must start with "item, tile". Cannot have "potion" regardless of adding unique id of addon, also needs ".name" at the end
find paintstripper textures file
Somehow its gone

implementing this practise into my folder structure as to not cause conflicts within the future
HAHAHAH do not implement. All textures broke. Ill do this another time

Some stained wood textures have their names in odd positions e.g "resistance_fire". I want to try and implement other resistance potions
look into warped planks, may answer data driven textures

add map colour to stained woods

TODO reduce light emissions with redstone clusters
TODO, implement a different growing method,
was thinking pushing the player to stay in the environment where they originally obtained the block, e.g budding glowstone would have to be grown in the nether.
However, thinking further down the line theres either 2 possible routes to take. Either, enforce this and make the player have to invest in another area
which can push the player in the comfort zone and hopefully feel more invested in this. The only issue i see with this method(still using budding glowstone as context)
is that in multiplayer a lot of big servers do reset their dimension which could detriment a players time invested in setting up said areas.
The other option is to have farms that "immitate" the environment where the original block came from. I.e have players place netherrack or soulsand around said budding
glowstone to "encourage" growth. Critiquing this idea is that over the years of seeing modded content, min/maxing really butchers the thematics of a mod breaking it down
into a game of maths(which okay fair, a lot of games rely on maths to bring the illusion of life)
So yeah? questions
maybe worth having a book due to the expansive nature of the addon. 
Crystal tree, named aptly as Crystallography 

Cool shit i thought about last night. Thanks brain i only got 4 hours asleep.

energised crystals; 
2nd or 3rd step to increasing the potency or duration of potions. Created by adding a shard(glowstone, redstone, echo, or ender pearl?) into an amethyst/gold jar between
2 quartz "pylons". On top of the device is a lightning rod. When the rod is struck with lightning its energy is transferred to the shard creating an energised crystal enhancing
the effects of said shard.

rtp potions;
Utilisation of ender pearls. Instead of the play being able to directly controlling the direction of teleportation, this broken down liquified ender pearl will
randomly teleport a player a certain range. Increases the potency of the potion increases the range of blocks that the player could teleport at.

echo potion
Utilisation of echo shards. At the time of consumption, the players location is saved. When the duration of the effect ends, the player is teleported and returns to the location
when they drunk the potion. duration increases the time the effect lasts. Potency doesnt do anything. However, an energized echo potion can be "linked" with an echo shard pylon
almost acting as a return node for players.

in order to get echo shards maybe implement something that causes quartz crystals to be "infected" by echo shards
possibly get echo shards by using sculk blocks

cant seem to work out a way for the texture so stand above the current block, will have to work on it. Or scrap the idea if it doesnt come out
