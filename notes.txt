scrapped texture overlaying and data driven textures. THey just dont have that POW to them
lang file, full stop is needed in some cases, string must start with "item, tile". Cannot have "potion" regardless of adding unique id of addon, also needs ".name" at the end
find paintstripper textures file
Somehow its gone

implementing this practise into my folder structure as to not cause conflicts within the future
HAHAHAH do not implement. All textures broke. Ill do this another time

Some stained wood textures have their names in odd positions e.g "resistance_fire". I want to try and implement other resistance potions
look into warped planks, may answer data driven textures

add map colour to stained woods

TODO reduce light emissions with redstone clusters
TODO, implement a different growing method,
was thinking pushing the player to stay in the environment where they originally obtained the block, e.g budding glowstone would have to be grown in the nether.
However, thinking further down the line theres either 2 possible routes to take. Either, enforce this and make the player have to invest in another area
which can push the player in the comfort zone and hopefully feel more invested in this. The only issue i see with this method(still using budding glowstone as context)
is that in multiplayer a lot of big servers do reset their dimension which could detriment a players time invested in setting up said areas.
The other option is to have farms that "immitate" the environment where the original block came from. I.e have players place netherrack or soulsand around said budding
glowstone to "encourage" growth. Critiquing this idea is that over the years of seeing modded content, min/maxing really butchers the thematics of a mod breaking it down
into a game of maths(which okay fair, a lot of games rely on maths to bring the illusion of life)
So yeah? questions
maybe worth having a book due to the expansive nature of the addon.
