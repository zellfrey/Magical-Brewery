scrapped texture overlaying and data driven textures. THey just dont have that POW to them
lang file, full stop is needed in some cases, string must start with "item, tile". Cannot have "potion" regardless of adding unique id of addon, also needs ".name" at the end
find paintstripper textures file
Somehow its gone

implementing this practise into my folder structure as to not cause conflicts within the future
HAHAHAH do not implement. All textures broke. Ill do this another time

Some stained wood textures have their names in odd positions e.g "resistance_fire". I want to try and implement other resistance potions
look into warped planks, may answer data driven textures

add map colour to stained woods

tiered glass bottles

TODO reduce light emissions with redstone clusters
TODO, implement a different growing method,
was thinking pushing the player to stay in the environment where they originally obtained the block, e.g budding glowstone would have to be grown in the nether.
However, thinking further down the line theres either 2 possible routes to take. Either, enforce this and make the player have to invest in another area
which can push the player in the comfort zone and hopefully feel more invested in this. The only issue i see with this method(still using budding glowstone as context)
is that in multiplayer a lot of big servers do reset their dimension which could detriment a players time invested in setting up said areas.
The other option is to have farms that "immitate" the environment where the original block came from. I.e have players place netherrack or soulsand around said budding
glowstone to "encourage" growth. Critiquing this idea is that over the years of seeing modded content, min/maxing really butchers the thematics of a mod breaking it down
into a game of maths(which okay fair, a lot of games rely on maths to bring the illusion of life)
So yeah? questions
maybe worth having a book due to the expansive nature of the addon. 
Crystal tree, named aptly as Crystallography 

Cool shit i thought about last night. Thanks brain i only got 4 hours asleep.

energised crystals; 
2nd or 3rd step to increasing the potency or duration of potions. Created by adding a shard(glowstone, redstone, echo, or ender pearl?) into an amethyst/gold jar between
2 quartz "pylons". On top of the device is a lightning rod. When the rod is struck with lightning its energy is transferred to the shard creating an energised crystal enhancing
the effects of said shard.

rtp potions;
Utilisation of ender pearls. Instead of the play being able to directly controlling the direction of teleportation, this broken down liquified ender pearl will
randomly teleport a player a certain range. Increases the potency of the potion increases the range of blocks that the player could teleport at.

echo potion
Utilisation of echo shards. At the time of consumption, the players location is saved. When the duration of the effect ends, the player is teleported and returns to the location
when they drunk the potion. duration increases the time the effect lasts. Potency doesnt do anything. However, an energized echo potion can be "linked" with an echo shard pylon
almost acting as a return node for players.

in order to get echo shards maybe implement something that causes quartz crystals to be "infected" by echo shards
possibly get echo shards by using sculk blocks

cant seem to work out a way for the texture so stand above the current block, will have to work on it. Or scrap the idea if it doesnt come out
entirely how i want it

amethyst, structural, brings tranquility hence stabilising magical potions
quartz, power transfer, focuses intentions, hence allowing for power transfer
glowstone, potency
redstone, duration
echo - exception, used for brewing echo potions

Cask has x number of charges. The no of effects in the container can determine the amount of charges it takes out of the cask
Visually the cask looses its stained look and “cracks” of the original wood appear

Stained planks are made by “dipping them” in cauldrons with potions, if not able to create this mechanic, fallback to 1 potion = 1 stained wood
in crafting table. The type i.e long, strong, splash does not effect the outcome and only the potion id determines the stained wood.


Cask,6 stained woods + 2 iron ingots(barrel braces).
States, charges, block face direction, contained potion id (represented by integer), potion type, fill level, time until completion/
aging (represented in stages, again int count)
Finally should fill level determine the amount of charges depleted when a potion has "aged"/absorbed the cask effect

Aging seals. Further down the line in which players can create "wax" seals that can effect the outcome of the aging process.
e.g, seal of potency which increases the potency level of said barrel(seal of duration)
Thinking further down this path, if a potion of lingering or splash is used, this will fix the potion combination to that type.

So,
cask of healing, and speed potion. This will become a healing/speed potion.
If its speed 2, will be healing/speed 2 potion. And so on
If the cask has a seal of potency, the outcome will be healing 2/X potion.


Late game idea, implement a "time" room, which will decrease the time taken for aging to be complete.
A simple cubed multiblock where casks can be placed inside. Those casks have a better chance of going through the aging
stages/process 

//Will add back later when we are able to check more specific block entity properties
            // if(block.typeId === "minecraft:cauldron"){
            //     const fluidContainer =  block.getComponent("minecraft:fluidContainer")
            //     console.warn(fluidContainer.fillLevel + "  " +  fluidContainer.getFluidType())
            //     const colours = fluidContainer.fluidColor;
            //     console.warn("colours")
            //     console.warn(colours.alpha + colours.blue + colours.green + colours.red)
            //     const cauldronChest = block.getComponent("inventory");
            //     if (cauldronChest == null) {

            //         console.warn(`The block does not have an inventory component.`);
            //         return; 
            //     }
            // }

block.getComponent("minecraft:fluidContainer").fillLevel
block.getComponent("minecraft:fluidContainer").getFluidType()
possibly use rgba value
if i cant do that, just do the age old method of crafting table, 1 potion = 1 stained plank


TODO: Implement a method to obtain shards in order to create each seed thus starting the crystal growing 
process.
TODO: Look into recipe to create seeds.
TODO: Add mining component along with item specific array --  based speed added, will look into item specific speeds at a later date
TODO: Echo seeds, pretty self explanatory, use echo shards that player finds in ancient cities
TODO: Amethyst seeds, use amethyst shards. 

pure crystal dust acquisition,
clean in water,
burn near candles, use different colours for different shards
use note blocks to cleanse, different notes clean for different shards
let sit under the full moon to absorb lunar energy


Selenite tower: echo selenite tower, used to link echo + potions allowing for travelling to location of echo selenite tower
allows the focusing of echo potions to specific frequency allowing a deeper connection between the tower and potion.
When a user drinks a potion, they absorb the vibrational energy allowing them to reconnect to the other half 
i.e the echo selenite tower

amethyst, peace, maybe the wind chimes can be used to calm mobs, e.g angry mobs turn to calm or stop pursuing the player
Shungite? Maybe use that as a anchor or protective base

alchemy research, craft special cauldron, similar to skyrim

lock potion, a combination of ender pearls and echo shards. Locking the player in a position for a brief period of time 

Will continue with the mechanic of cleaning crystals later. 

currently there is no way of obtaining the potion id from a 
look into giving glass bottles as a byproduct from stained planks

TODO: implement function to change cask tag into localised language

Turtle Master. Seeing as its mixed, make a separate guard rdclause for this unique instance. Or look into adding more block Tags
This method of adding more block tags maybe stupid as fuck
            
TODO: Add sounds to various cask interactions
TODO: Send messages using .lang file. Currently its in english


TODO: implement a method to utilise this string: ["§r§7" + capitalize(caskEffect) + "§r§7 (2:00)"]
TODO: Use a failsafe guard clause just in case cask data does not exist "if(Object.keys(cask).length === 0) cask = createCask(dimension.id, {x, y, z})"

Just had a scary thought. What if players push casks with a piston?
I have to update the cask in the caskDB. Potentially having to take the direction the piston was pushing and, uhmmm i dont have the words so ill figure it out.
But its on the backburner


TODO: Make a check that sorts the potion extra effects allowing for potions with the same effects to combine without being order specific
TODO: Aging time should be increased by the number of effects that are within the cask(i.e the potion). This exponentially increases
TODO: Aging will not happen if a potion effect is the same as the cask effect DONE
TODO: Update Tasting Spoon to support multiple potion effects within a cask
TODO: Make function to spawn multiple splash/lingering potions that have extra effects

TODO: Re-structure cask model
TODO: Revision cask front textures(add cork texture, look to the glass bottle"corks")

So aging time. Affected by fill level and amount of effects within the potion liquid(i.e the extra effects)
The less in the cask, the shorter the time. The greater the effects, the longer the time

textures to make,
pocket watch,
tasting spoon,
amethyst lingering and splash potion.
Revise casks textures
