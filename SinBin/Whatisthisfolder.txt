This is the sinBin

A place for the naughty files that just didn't sit right with the mod.

Now usually you would throw these files out into the cold pouring rain, however I have hoarding tendencies, so i kept
them just incase, collecting dust, withering in a corner.
Maybe, after a few trials, they may come back to join their friends upstairs at the party
